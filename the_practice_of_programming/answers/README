These are my answers too all the exercises in The Practice of
Programming. The solutions are in the file exercises.txt, which is also
an index into the many source code files.

Much of the code is based on code presented in the book or downloaded
from http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/tpop/code.html. That code comes with
the notice:

	You may use this code for any purpose, as long as you leave the
	copyright notice and book citation attached.

The parts of the code that are my own work are in the public domain.

Some of the programs rely on these text files from Project Gutenberg:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/2ws2410.txt
http://www.gutenberg.org/files/76/76.txt
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext90/kjv10.txt
http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4300/old/ulyss12.txt

As of this writing Project Gutenberg is in the process of reorganizing
their filing system to index texts by number instead of name. The
2ws2410.txt and kjv10.txt links may break.
